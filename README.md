# IDCE-302-Lab-4

My script has three problems to solve. They are:
- Exercise-1: Capitalizing first and fourth letters of a name.
-Exercise-2: Parsing and managing a multi-line string.
-Exercise-3: Extracting latitude and longitude from a url.

I have encountered problems for exercise 2 for parsing and managing longer strings, especially how to solve the problems with comma. Some text required comma being attached after that and some did not. So, different strategies were required for both. Moreover, I had problem for exercise 3 as well as I did not know to extract latitude and longitude from our class or textbook.

I have fixed the errors by replacing one with comma and replacing the whole line for another. TA helped me a lot for all of them.
